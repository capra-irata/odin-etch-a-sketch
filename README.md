GOAL: Create a 16x16 grid of elements that change color when hovered. Allow the
user to enter a number for their desired grid size and dynamically change the
grid area. Once complete, adjust the functionality so instead of a single color
change, each hover gives the grid square a random RGB value. Adjust again so
each pass across a grid square increments the percentage of black by 10%.

Demonstrate knowledge of DOM manipulation.
